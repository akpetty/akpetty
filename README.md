# 🌍 Alek Petty | Polar Climate Scientist

Hi! I'm **Alek**, a Research Scientist at UMD (go terps!) specializing in **polar climate change prediction** with a strong focus on sea ice - the floating ice over the Arctic and Southern Ocean.

**Research Interests**  
- ❄️ Polar and global climate variability, especially sea ice (e.g. Arctic sea ice decline).
- 📊 Climate model projections (CMIP6/CESM)
- 🛰️ Remote sensing & data assimilation (including OSSEs)

**Skills**  
- 🛠 Python, GIS & Remote Sensing, Machine Learning and AI tools, Cloud-Native data and analysis  

🚨 I am what some might call an academic coder... This means I don't pay nearly enough attention to documentation and testing as I should do, small rushed projects, lack of training and oversight, lots of excuses, so please reach out if any of my code doesn't make sense or you want help running things. 

🚀 I am (virtually) always open to collaborations! Please do reach out if you are working on something interesting in climate science, data analysis, or satellite-based research.
