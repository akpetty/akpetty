# 🌍 Alek Petty | Polar Climate Scientist

Hi! I'm **Alek**, a Research Scientist at UMD (go terps!) specializing in **polar climate change prediction** with a strong focus on sea ice - the floating ice over the Arctic and Southern Ocean.

**Research Interests**  
- ❄️ Polar and global climate variability, especially sea ice (e.g. Arctic sea ice decline).
- 📊 Climate model projections (CMIP6/CESM)
- 🛰️ Remote sensing (imagery and lidar) & data assimilation (OSSEs)

**Skills**  
- 🛠 Python, GIS & Remote Sensing, Machine Learning and AI tools, cloud-native data and analysis . 

🚨 I am what some might call an academic coder... This means my projects are a bit hacky, short-livedm under-funded etc, and I thus don't pay nearly enough attention to documentation and testing as I should do. So, please reach out if any of my code doesn't make sense or you want help running things. 

🚀 I am (virtually) always open to collaboration! Please do reach out if you are working on something interesting in climate science, data analysis, or satellite-based research.
